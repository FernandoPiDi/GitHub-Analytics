# GitHub Analytics

Monorepo is built with NX, containing a FastAPI backend and a React frontend. It generates Recharts visualizations based on the user's natural language input and dynamically queried data from the GitHub GraphQL API (commits, PRs, and issues). The Charts are generated by an AI multi-agent implementation in LangChain and LangGraph.

## Tech Stack

### Backend

- FastAPI
- LangChain + Azure OpenAI for AI agents
- Poetry for Python dependency management
- Pytest for testing
- Ruff for linting

### Frontend

- React 18
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Recharts for data visualization
- Vite for building
- Vitest for testing

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18+)
- Python (v3.11+)
- Poetry for Python dependency management
- pnpm (recommended) or npm
- Azure OpenAI API access

## Project Structure

```
apps/
├── backend/ # FastAPI backend application
│ ├── src/ # Source code
└── frontend/ # React frontend application
│ ├── src/ # Source code
```

## Setup

1. Install Nx globally (optional but recommended):

```sh
npm install -g @nx/cli
```

2. Install project dependencies:

```sh
pnpm install
cd apps/backend && poetry install
```

3. Configure environment variables:

   - Copy `apps/backend/.env.dist` to `apps/backend/.env`
   - Set the following required variables:
     ```
     AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key
     AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=your_endpoint
     AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT=your_deployment
     CODEGEN_GH_AUTH=your_github_token
     ```

## Running the Project

To run both frontend and backend simultaneously:

```sh
pnpm nx run-many -t serve
```
